Just wrapped up a hands-on Data Analytics project from scratch—all the way from messy SQL data to interactive Power BI dashboards!
Project Highlights:
I created, merged, and cleaned two large tables (Sales Orders & Customer Info) using SQL Server—dealing with nulls, typos, inconsistent formats, duplicate records, and all the real-world data headaches.
All cleaning and transformation steps were powered by SQL scripts. I’m sharing the exact code I used in the post for anyone who’s struggling with dirty data!
Power BI Results & Insights:
Here’s what I learned from each visual:
Scatter Plot—Sum of Quantity by Product and TotalSales
Key Insight: Product-wise sales volumes and revenues cluster distinctly. Earphone and Laptop dominate the upper ranges, indicating they are core, high-performing products.
Treemap—Sum of UnitPrice by Product
Key Insight: Earphone leads total sales value, followed by Laptop. Clear signal for where revenue opportunities and pricing focus lie.
Bar—Sum of TotalSales by Region
Key Insight: "Unknown" regions have the highest sales—a sign to improve data entry practices. Among known regions, North and South outperform East and West, guiding market allocation.
Line—Sum of TotalSales by Month
Key Insight: Seasonal peaks in July, October, and November show sales cycles. Planning for these spikes can optimize promotions and inventory.
Donut—Sum of TotalSales by Country
Key Insight: The US is the largest market, closely followed by Canada and India. Regional targeting will drive future growth.
Horizontal Bar—Sum of TotalSales by Product
Key Insight: Earphone is the top-selling product, trailed by Laptop and Phone—helping refine product strategy and stock prioritization.
Map—Sum of TotalSales by Country
Key Insight: Sales are concentrated in North America, with meaningful presence in India—helpful for expansion analysis.
SQL Data Cleaning:
I posted all key SQL queries I used to clean and prep the data, including:
Deduplication
Handling NULLs and missing info
Standardizing text case
Date conversions
Fixing categorical typos

Takeaway:
Going hands-on with dirty data and full-stack reporting taught me why careful cleaning unlocks powerful insights. Every chart is only as reliable as the SQL work behind it!
